# 🎯 1. Project Overview  
This E-Sports Tournament App is a fully functional Flutter UI project created as part of my Internshala internship assignment.  
The app replicates a Figma design and demonstrates my skills in:

- Figma → Flutter UI conversion  
- Responsive layouts  
- State management using Provider  
- Clean architecture and reusable widgets  
- Real world multi-section app development  

The UI includes esports categories, arena sections, match cards, game modes, filters, and bottom navigation.
